# Math Operations Script

This Python script performs a series of mathematical operations, divided into two main tasks:

## üî¢ Task 1: Factorial Calculation

This task calculates the factorial of a user-input number using recursion.

### Code Description:

* Defines a recursive function `fact(a)` to compute factorial.
* Takes an integer input from the user.
* Prints the factorial result.

### Sample Output:

```
Enter your Number: 5
Factorial: 120
```

## üßÆ Task 2: Mathematical Operations

This task performs several mathematical operations on the input number:

* Square root using `math.sqrt()`
* Natural logarithm using `math.log()`
* Radian conversion using `math.radians()`
* Sine value using `math.sin()`

### Sample Output:

```
Square root of the number is 2.23606797749979
Natural log of the number is 1.6094379124341003
Sine value of the number is 0.17364817766693033
```

## ‚úÖ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
3. Enter an integer when prompted.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes and Suggestions

* **Variable Order**: `a` must be defined before calling `fact(a)`.
* **Imports**: `math` is imported multiple times; only one import is needed.
* **Error Handling**: Consider adding checks to handle negative numbers and invalid inputs.
* **Optimization**: Refactor the code for better readability and structure.
